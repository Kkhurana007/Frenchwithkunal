    "text": "In French, -re verbs are another group of regular verbs that follow their own conjugation pattern. To conjugate an -re verb in the present tense, you remove the -re ending from the infinitive, leaving the stem, and then add the following endings: -s, -s, -, -ons, -ez, -ent. For example, with the verb “vendre” (to sell):\nje vends (I sell) tu vends (you sell, informal) il/elle vend (he/she sells) nous vendons (we sell) vous vendez (you sell, formal/plural) ils/elles vendent (they sell)\nMost -re verbs, like attendre (to wait) or perdre (to lose), follow this regular conjugation pattern, making them predictable and relatively easy to conjugate in various tenses. However, similar to other verb categories, there are some irregular -re verbs that don’t follow these rules.\nFor details, you may look at this pdf."

    "text": "In French, pronunciation of vowels and consonants can be quite distinct compared to English. The French vowels include sounds like “a” (ah), “e” (uh, as in “le”), “i” (ee), “o” (oh), and “u” (ew, like “une”). Additionally, French has nasal vowels (e.g., “an,” “on,” “un”), where air is directed through the nose. Consonants in French are mostly similar to English, but some have slight differences. For instance, “r” is pronounced with a guttural sound from the back of the throat, while “h” is always silent. The French “c” is soft (like “s”) before “e” or “i” and hard (like “k”) otherwise. For better understanding and practice, you can find an educational resource for pronunciation at this link and by watching this video."

To conjugate an -er verb in the present tense, you begin by removing the -er ending from the infinitive form of the verb, leaving the stem. Then, you add the appropriate endings depending on the subject pronoun. For example, with the verb “parler” (to speak):\nje parle (I speak) tu parles (you speak, informal) il/elle parle (he/she speaks) nous parlons (we speak) vous parlez (you speak, formal/plural) ils/elles parlent (they speak) The endings for the present tense are: -e, -es, -e, -ons, -ez, -ent.

    "text": "In French, numbers are pronounced in a structured way that follows specific rules. Numbers 1 through 16 have unique names, such as “un” (1), “deux” (2), and “dix-sept” (17). For numbers between 17 and 69, they are formed by combining the tens and ones, such as “vingt-trois” (23) or “quarante-neuf” (49). For numbers 70 and above, the system changes slightly. In France, 70 is said as “soixante-dix” (literally “sixty-ten”), 71 as “soixante-et-onze” (“sixty-eleven”), and so on, up to 79. Numbers in the 80s are based on “quatre-vingts” (literally “four twenties”), so 82 is “quatre-vingt-deux.” For numbers in the 90s, it combines “quatre-vingt” with the numbers from 10 to 19, like “quatre-vingt-dix” (90) or “quatre-vingt-quatorze” (94). Large numbers, like thousands, are pronounced similarly to English, with “mille” for 1,000 or “million” for 1,000,000.\nYou may look at these pdfs to learn more numbers1to20, numbers21to2billion."

For example, je vais manger means “I am going to eat,” and nous allons voyager means “we are going to travel.” This structure helps you express actions happening soon without needing to conjugate the main verb.\nHere are some examples:\n\nExample-1\nExample-2"

We also covered daily conversations, such as asking “Comment ça va?” (How are you?) or “Où est la boulangerie?” (Where is the bakery?). Additionally, we went over basic household items like “la table” (the table), “le lit” (the bed), and “le frigo” (the fridge) to help you navigate French-speaking environments with ease. Whether you’re a language enthusiast or just starting out, these essentials are a great foundation for building your French skills!"
