In French, -er verbs are the most common and are considered regular verbs. These verbs follow a standard conjugation pattern in different tenses, making them relatively easy to learn. To conjugate an -er verb in the present tense, you begin by removing the -er ending from the infinitive form of the verb, leaving the stem. Then, you add the appropriate endings depending on the subject pronoun. For example, with the verb "parler" (to speak):

je parle (I speak) tu parles (you speak, informal) il/elle parle (he/she speaks) nous parlons (we speak) vous parlez (you speak, formal/plural) ils/elles parlent (they speak) The endings for the present tense are: -e, -es, -e, -ons, -ez, -ent. These are applied to all regular -er verbs.
