In French, numbers are pronounced in a structured way that follows specific rules. Numbers 1 through 16 have unique names, such as "un" (1), "deux" (2), and "dix-sept" (17). For numbers between 17 and 69, they are formed by combining the tens and ones, such as "vingt-trois" (23) or "quarante-neuf" (49). For numbers 70 and above, the system changes slightly. In France, 70 is said as "soixante-dix" (literally "sixty-ten"), 71 as "soixante-et-onze" ("sixty-eleven"), and so on, up to 79. Numbers in the 80s are based on "quatre-vingts" (literally "four twenties"), so 82 is "quatre-vingt-deux." For numbers in the 90s, it combines "quatre-vingt" with the numbers from 10 to 19, like "quatre-vingt-dix" (90) or "quatre-vingt-quatorze" (94). Large numbers, like thousands, are pronounced similarly to English, with "mille" for 1,000 or "million" for 1,000,000.
