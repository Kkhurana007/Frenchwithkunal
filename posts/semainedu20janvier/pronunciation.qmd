In French, pronunciation of vowels and consonants can be quite distinct compared to English. The French vowels include sounds like "a" (ah), "e" (uh, as in "le"), "i" (ee), "o" (oh), and "u" (ew, like "une"). Additionally, French has nasal vowels (e.g., "an," "on," "un"), where air is directed through the nose. Consonants in French are mostly similar to English, but some have slight differences. For instance, "r" is pronounced with a guttural sound from the back of the throat, while "h" is always silent. The French "c" is soft (like "s") before "e" or "i" and hard (like "k") otherwise.
