In French, -ir verbs are another category of regular verbs, and they follow a distinct conjugation pattern. To conjugate an -ir verb in the present tense, you remove the -ir ending from the infinitive, leaving the stem, and then add the appropriate endings: -s, -s, -t, -ssons, -ssez, -ssent. For example, with the verb "finir" (to finish):

je finis (I finish)
tu finis (you finish, informal)
il/elle finit (he/she finishes)
nous finissons (we finish)
vous finissez (you finish, formal/plural)
ils/elles finissent (they finish)

Most -ir verbs, like choisir (to choose) or r√©ussir (to succeed), follow this regular conjugation pattern, making them easier to learn compared to irregular verbs.
